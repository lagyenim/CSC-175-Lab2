// One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. 
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the total square footage 
// in a tract of land, calculates, and prints the result of the conversion 
// from square feet to acres. Create a constant named ACRE_FACTOR to express 
// the conversion factor. Format the output to limit the number of digits after 
// the decimal point to two digits.
// Place your solution code here for Lab2
